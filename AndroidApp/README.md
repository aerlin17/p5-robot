Importing Android Studio projects can sometimes be tedious, depending on the file tree structure detected by Android Studio. If this method does not work immediately you might need to google the errors and move some files around.

1. Import the folder into Android Studio
2. Sync with Gradle
3. Resolve any errors. These typically relate to Gradle files being misplaced or not recognized
4. Enable Developer Mode on your Android phone
5. Connect a phone to your pc, using the phone's charging cable or setup the emulator
6. (Skip if you use the emulator) Allow USB Debugging in the popup
7. (Skip if you use the emulator) Make sure Android Studio recognizes the phone
8. Run MainActivity.java
